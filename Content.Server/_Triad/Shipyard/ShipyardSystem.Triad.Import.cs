// Triad: legacy import. Drains the old ship-save system into the drydock. Old saves are files on the
// player's own disk, so this is a conversation: the client offers a manifest of what it holds, the
// server says which of those it will accept, and the payload for the one ship being imported crosses
// the wire only when the player presses the button.
//
// Two authorities, and only one follows the tamper mode. The tamper policy decides whether a document
// is trusted enough to load: under enforce a file not signed by our key is refused unless the player
// holds a permit, notify lets it through with an audit row, off lets it through silently. The consume
// ledger decides whether a file has already bought a ship and whether the account has import
// allowance left, and it answers in every mode. The one step that reaches the player's disk, retiring
// the file to backup, is enforce-only, so a non-enforcing server can rehearse the real path without
// eating a save that still has to work somewhere else.
