/// <para>Wall clock, not game-thread time, and under slicing that stops being a footnote about two
/// phases and becomes the whole picture. Every phase now spans ticks the server spent running
/// normally, so <c>serialize=900ms</c> no longer means anyone waited 900 ms: it means the phase took
/// 900 ms of clock to get through a few milliseconds at a time. The number that says whether other
/// players felt anything is the worst single slice, which the five-argument
/// <see cref="Format(string,Guid,int,double,int)"/> puts on the same line.</para>
///
/// <para>The flat <c>phase=Nms</c> line Loki pattern-matches also gained four keys with the slicing
/// change - <c>freeze</c>, <c>purge</c>, <c>strip</c> and <c>unwind</c> - so anything matching the
/// old key set exactly will see them.</para>
///
/// <para>Emitted at Info: a store or retrieve is a rare deliberate player action, so one line each
