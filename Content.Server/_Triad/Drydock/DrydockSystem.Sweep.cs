/// <para>Four verdicts, from the design page. A hull that could have brought itself home, meaning a
/// piloting console and at least one dock aboard, is taken into the lot by the forced store at the
/// configured share of its appraisal, with the owner free to reclaim it. A hull that could not is
/// written off: the row says Destroyed, the revisions stay, and the panel's Restore to is the way
/// back. A hull the forced store would not file stays checked out with a ShipStranded row naming the
/// failure. And a round the server never reaches the end of writes nothing, which is itself the
/// signal: the panel's Stranded chip is where those rows surface.</para>
///
/// <para>The sweep starts when the round ends, inside the restart window, and runs the pipeline
/// inline: no job, no slicing, the engine's own serializer. Slicing protects bystanders from tick
/// hitches and costs twice the wall time to do it, and at round end there are no bystanders left.
/// The restart itself is held by <see cref="HoldRestartForSweep"/> until the sweep drains or its
/// ceiling passes, because three separate callers reach RestartRound and any of them would pull the
